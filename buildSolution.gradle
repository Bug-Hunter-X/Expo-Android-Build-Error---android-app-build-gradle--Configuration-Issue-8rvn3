The solution typically involves reviewing the `android/app/build.gradle` file and checking for inconsistencies.  This may include:

* **Dependency Versions:** Ensuring all dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version and other libraries used in the project.
* **Plugin Versions:** Checking that necessary Gradle plugins are up-to-date and correctly configured.
* **Build Configurations:**  Correctly setting the `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, and other build configurations to target specific Android versions.

**Example (Illustrative):**

The original `build.gradle` might have an incorrect dependency or a missing plugin:

```gradle
//build.gradle (Incorrect)
dependencies {
    implementation "com.example:incorrect-dependency:1.0"
}
```

The solution `buildSolution.gradle` corrects the dependency:

```gradle
//buildSolution.gradle (Correct)
dependencies {
    implementation "com.example:correct-dependency:1.0"
}
```

Always refer to the official Expo documentation for the most up-to-date build configurations and dependency requirements for your specific Expo SDK version.
